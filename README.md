# PDF RAG Bot 

## Overview  
This is a **simple and basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) bot** designed to process **PDF documents** and provide intelligent responses based on their content. The bot extracts text from PDFs, generates embeddings, retrieves relevant context, and uses an LLM to generate accurate answers.

## Features  
âœ… **PDF Parsing** â€“ Extracts text from uploaded PDF files.  
âœ… **Embedding Generation** â€“ Converts extracted text into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.  
âœ… **Contextual Retrieval** â€“ Fetches the most relevant document sections for queries.  
âœ… **LLM Integration** â€“ Uses an AI model to generate responses based on retrieved data.  

## How It Works  
1. **Upload PDFs** â€“ The bot processes the uploaded PDF and extracts text.  
2. **Embedding & Indexing** â€“ The extracted content is converted into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.  
3. **Query Processing** â€“ Users enter queries, and the bot fetches relevant text chunks.  
4. **Response Generation** â€“ The AI model formulates a response based on the retrieved content.
